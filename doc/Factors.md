#Factors

##Saturation

Too many users, too many messages and requests, poor infrastructure in many situations from large gatherings to urban emergencies

##Out of Range

There are many places without connectivity due to economic or political circumstances, or sometimes bad luck or thick walls.

##Cost

Mobile Bandwidth is still expensive and precious in many parts of the world, and upload is slower than down (consumption is easier than Creation)

##Surveillance

Mobile surveillance is largely dependent upon centralized infrastructure and real name registered identities.
