# THE WIND

![logo](doc/img/wind.png)

Wind is spontaneous and often unexpected. It can manifest as a slight breeze, or a powerful gale. It can move in many directions and as a focused force. It can gently spread the seeds of life, and be a fearful force of destruction. Wind can carry a message for miles, even around the world. Wind can be harnessed and turned into energy.

# THE FARM (THIS REPO)

This is the place from where we will gather resources, ideas, visions, and plans, and work to generate more wind, or wind-y inspired efforts, around the world.
