![logo](doc/img/wind.png)

Wind is spontaneous and often unexpected. It can manifest as a slight breeze, or a powerful gale. It can move in many directions and as a focused force. It can gently spread the seeds of life, and be a fearful force of destruction. Wind can carry a message for miles, even around the world. Wind can be harnessed and turned into energy.
